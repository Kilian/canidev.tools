      "Notes": "1. In the **Memory** tab, use the camera icon (top-left) titled, \"Take snapshot\" to capture the heap stack and establish a baseline.\n2. Perform any operation on the app that is suspected to leak memory, and then take another snapshot.\n3. To compare two snapshots, click the button that looks like a Venn diagram next to the camera icon. The diff shows you where memory was allocated or freed between the two snapshots, indicating potential candidates leaking the memory.\n",
